# ****Pyber_Analysis****

## Overview of Project
- To see how the data fared in relation to the city type. Using the ride sharing data that has already been combed through and Pythons skills, results were created for the analysis of the ride sharing data by city type.
-  A written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results: 
*Three categories of city types in this analysis: Urban, Suburban, and Rural.*

  - From the pie chart above and table above, It is seen that the majority of PyBer's customers and drivers are located in Urban cities with 62.7% of the total fares. Urban cities has a staggering amount of drivers around thirty times more compared to rural areas. Because of this excess supply of driver in comparison to customers, the average fare per driver is $16.57 which is lower than the rura, and suburban market.
  - The only city with more total drivers than total riders is Urban.
  - Suburban cities has a healthy balance between customers, and drivers with fare being $6.44 higher than urban cities as well as the average driver fare being $22.93 highr than urban cities. Surburban is the middle ground inbetween urban number, and rural numbers. 
  - The highest average fare per driver is in Rural markert where the supply of drivers is lower than the demand from riders. The ratio of this supply, and demand imbalance is 2:1. 
  - Due to the low supply of rural drivers, the average fare per driver is ~40% higher than suburban drivers and ~235% higher than urban drivers

- The graph above shows the weekly fares of each city type from Jan 1, 2019 to April 29, 2019 which is considered the first quarter of 2019. Total fares for each city type have been semi-consistent maintaining a certain range of revenue. 
  - Urban cities range is $1,500-$2,500
  - Suburban citites range is $500-$1500
  - Rural cities range is $0-$500.
 - There is a peak in fares mid February for all city types, and a mutual dip in March. 

## Summary:
- Provide more drivers in rural cities to offput the higher prices as this can deter new customers from trying PyBer services. 
  - Create a campaign spreading awareness of the services to gain new customers, and drivers as well as providing drivers with incentives to expand their driving range from suburban to rural.
- With the peak in total fares in Feburary, and possibly other times in the year were there is local events or national holidays, there should be an analysis conducted to determine if there was any events during those times. If there was certain events happening were demand for drivers is high, then PyBer can increase prices "surge prices." 
- Reduce the number of total drivers in Urban cities since there is a higher number of drivers to riders to increase profit margins. A good example of a good ratio of drivers to customers is Suburban where there is healthy amount of drivers to total riders, and the average fare per driver was ~x2 higher. Another option is to use the excess drivers to other possible delivery services such as food delivery under the PyBer services if expanding services in the Urban market is deemed actionable. 
- Add another input of data which is customer satisfaction, and if possible to see the rentention rate of riders in correlation to their overall satisfaction to the service they have recieved.

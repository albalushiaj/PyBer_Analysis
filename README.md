# ****Pyber_Analysis****

## Overview of Project
- To see how the data fared in relation to the city type. Using the ride sharing data that has already been combed through and Pythons skills, results were created for the analysis of the ride sharing data by city type.
-  a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results:

  - From the pie chart above, It is seen that the majority of PyBer's customers and drivers are located in Urban cities with 62.7% of the total fares. Urban cities has a staggering amount of drivers around thirty times more compared to rural areas. Because of this excess supply of driver in comparison to customers, the average fare per driver is $16.57 which is lower than the rura, and suburban market.
  - The only city with more total drivers than total riders is Urban.
  - The highest average fare per driver is in Rural markert where the supply of drivers is lower than the demand from riders. 

Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
- There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.
## Summary:
